                answer: "I am from Jeju Island and lived there until I came to Seoul when I was six. It is one of the most beautiful islands in the world and known for its abundant wind, rocks and women. I still remember swimming with my friends near Yongduam Rock, one of the popular tourist attractions."

                answer: "I graduated from Wing Sky University. The school is jokingly called Wing Sky High School because of its small campus. I chose this school because it is located not far from my home and because of the excellent faculty. There are many universities near my school, which helped me participate in many extracurricular activities with the students."

                answer: "Safety and good service are both important. However, to me, safety is more important. No matter how good the service is, you will not be able to enjoy it if you do not feel safe. In fact, there is nothing more important than human life."

                question: "What is the worst part of being a flight attendant?",
                answer: "Becoming a flight attendant has been my dream since I was young, so I have actually never thought about the downsides of this job. Still, if I had to pick one thing, it would be the irregular schedule. Maybe it will not be easy for me to do things like registering for an academy or attending family gatherings. However, there are online lectures, and we can make video calls, so I do not think those will be a big problem."

                answer: "I am confident that I can work well with anyone because I enjoy relationships with people. However, I think it is hard to work with an irresponsible colleague who is not punctual. I consider being on time important because it is a promise I made to my workplace, co-workers and even customers."

                answer: "I've worked as both a leader and a follower and found out that I'm more of a follower. I'm quick-witted, so I quickly figure out what the leader wants and am able to support her. Having enough experience as a follower will make me a great leader later."

                answer: "Sometimes it's more efficient to work alone, and sometimes with many people. However, I prefer working as a team. Working with people for a common goal is fun and rewarding. By helping others and getting their help, I learn a lot and become better myself."
